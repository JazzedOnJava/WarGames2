# WarGames2
This project is inspired by the 1983 classic WarGames. In order to stop WWIII, you need to convince government computers that sometimes there is no winner. To do this, you need to play Tic-Tac-Toe. First create a program that allows you to play the game, but program the computer to be unbeatable, meaning Draw is the worst-case scenario for the CPU. You’ll need all the minimum features to continuously play the game, meaning at least a ‘new game’ button, 4 lines to make the game board, and clickable spaces to signify selections. The standard game should be Player vs CPU, but there are 10 features listed below that can be added to your game. The table will show the minimum number of features you need to add to the game for your group size. Smaller groups that go over can earn bonus points for more features.
